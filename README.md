# 🧠 AI Agent Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio. I design and build AI agents and automation systems that solve practical business problems. Every build here was created with real client use cases in mind, from automating back-office tasks to speeding up content workflows.

These are not experiments. They are working systems that can be deployed, adapted, and scaled.
